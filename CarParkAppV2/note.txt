Thinsg to do:

2) pass user set Timer to timer
3) do walk trails --> need find out a way to determine traisl and render it
4) forget password (send email)
5) close down search result --> gesture not workiing correctly
6) map marker design
7) get nearby carpark based on destination --> input destination details to backend and return nearby car park
8) find out how to communicate with the backend( firebase ) --> access(upload/edit/fetch)
9) open google maps navigation (might omit)
10) render History pressed page
