The code is very dirty(ie not clean) actually so no need force follow it.

And the image path is wrong because i did it inside my pc,
because image path is wrong, so for every screen need to change all the path(honestly can make one file import
all the image paths first) (thats why it is dirty) :(

In car Park details all the details havent set into varibles -->agn (thats why it is dirty) :( 

We should use Pixel 3a (random API) in andriod studio, because it is 393x808  dp and figma is 360 x 800 dp so kinda same
(avoid padding problem)
(i do it in another same phone actually so got padding problem) (because every phone dp not the same)

Home screen got padding problem.
And search result suppose can be close down using Animated view and gesture (i havent learn that yet so cant close haha)

Public review image shld not take the exact image from figma (i mean in the code) but shld set borderRadius and resize

And some part abit hard-coded like the setCategory and setSort in bottomPopUp in home screen, maybe need to change (

I also havent do the push up screen when keyboard pop up
because the sign up screen when keyboard pop up  we cant see anything

drawer pop up customize havent do yet

and some props need to pass around differrent screen havent done yet

Conclusion:
Code is dirty and need to clean a lot, so no need force follow it, feel free to change it to more dynamic.
And some onPress logic havent done yet (ie navigate, another navigate, share, search...)

Will delete on weds

Things to be resolved:
1. image path details (resolved)
2. 'carParkdetails' -- details need to set as variables
3. Home screen got padding problem.
4. search result suppose can be close down using Animated view and gesture 
5. Public review image shld not take the exact image from figma (i mean in the code) but shld set borderRadius and resize
6. some parts (ex. the setCategory and setSort in bottomPopUp in home screen) is hard coded
7. push up screen when keyboard pop up
8. drawer pop up customize havent do yet
9. some props need to pass around differrent screen havent done yet
10. some onPress logic (ie navigate, another navigate, share, search...)
