Create Empty React-native project 
Can see react-native docs

1) 
Add ANDROD_HOME path in PC 
( start-> environment -> New user varibles -> add andriod sdk path )
(usually in C:\Users\dell\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk)

2) Add platform-toosl Path in PC ( same thing -> but x2 click the PATH varibles and add new one)
C:\Users\dell\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\platform-tools



(gradle cant be copied, so basically cannot run in other PC, must create own react-native)
Here is the things need to changed: 
Compoenents folder
babel.config --> add react-reanimated plugin
package.json --> reference only see what need what dont need
metro.config.js
App.js
AndriodManifest.xml --> Add google API

andriod/.. /Java files
Just add assets folder and replace all the java files


There is a big bug and performance issue 
(bug --> need to press 2 times )
(as I cant find out how to read files directly in java, so need to send array to the java files)
(sending time is after u press Login or signup)
(text input in search bar is very slow)
